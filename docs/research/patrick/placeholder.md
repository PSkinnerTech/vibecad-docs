# Active Open Source Projects

## Text2CAD

This project, available on GitHub, introduces an AI framework for generating parametric CAD models from textual descriptions. It includes a data annotation pipeline that uses large language and vision models to create a dataset of text prompts with varying levels of complexity. The framework also features a transformer-based model for generating sequential CAD designs.

## Zoo Text-to-CAD

Zoo's Text-to-CAD is a commercial tool that creates editable B-Rep CAD files and meshes from natural language prompts. It is integrated into the Zoo Design Studio and is powered by their proprietary ML-ephant API. Unlike other text-to-3D models that produce static meshes, Zoo's tool generates editable STEP files.

## ML-ephant API

The ML-ephant API is the machine learning powerhouse behind Zoo's Text-to-CAD tool. It allows developers to programmatically generate CAD files from text prompts and integrate this functionality into their own applications. The API is available in multiple programming languages and can be fine-tuned with proprietary data for enterprise customers.

## Text-to-CAD (deanhu0822)

This GitHub repository is a fork of the Text2CAD project, indicating an independent effort to build upon the same foundational concepts of generating CAD models from text.

## CQAsk

CQAsk is an open-source tool that uses large language models to generate CAD models from text prompts. It features a user-friendly UI for interaction and supports customizable CAD specifications. The backend is built with Python and CadQuery.
